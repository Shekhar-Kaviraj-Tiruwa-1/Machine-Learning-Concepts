# Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Key Concepts Summary
**Machine Learning** = Computer programs that improve performance on a task through experience
- **Supervised Learning**: Learn from input-output pairs (labeled data)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Find patterns in data without labels

### Analogies to Remember
- **Supervised Learning** = Learning with a teacher who shows you the right answers
- **Unsupervised Learning** = Finding hidden patterns like a detective with no clues

### Essential Definitions
- **Training Set**: Data used to train the model
- **Feature (x)**: Input variable 
- **Target (y)**: Output variable to predict
- **m**: Number of training examples
- **Hypothesis h**: Function that maps x to y

### Practice Problems
1. **Classify these as supervised or unsupervised:**
   - Email spam detection → **Supervised** (has labels: spam/not spam)
   - Customer segmentation → **Unsupervised** (finding groups)

2. **Given housing data: size, bedrooms, location → price**
   - What's the feature? → **Size, bedrooms, location**
   - What's the target? → **Price**

### Real-World Application
**Netflix Recommendations**: Supervised learning uses your ratings (labels) to predict what you'll like

### Connection to Advanced Topics
This foundation leads to deep learning, where we stack multiple layers of these basic supervised learning units

### 10-Second Revision
*"Supervised = with labels, Unsupervised = find patterns, x=input, y=output"*
