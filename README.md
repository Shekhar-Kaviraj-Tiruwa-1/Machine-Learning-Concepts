Machine Learning Concepts
Welcome to my Machine Learning Concepts repository! üöÄ This is a personal knowledge dump where I store notes, code, and resources related to my journey in machine learning. My goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible reference for myself and others who are learning these topics.

üìö Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course Notes
The latest addition to this repository is a collection of notes from the renowned Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. These notes cover fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical advice, serving as a solid foundation for anyone new to the field.

Topics Covered:

Linear Regression: Understanding the core principles of predicting continuous values.

Logistic Regression: Diving into the world of classification and probability.

Neural Networks: Exploring the basics of building and training neural networks.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Learning about a powerful algorithm for classification and regression.

Unsupervised Learning: Discovering patterns in data with clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Bias vs. Variance: Grasping the trade-offs that are critical to model performance.

Machine Learning System Design: Practical advice on how to build and evaluate ML systems.

üìù Other Resources
This repository will continue to grow with more topics, including:

Python Libraries: Notes on using libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

Project Examples: Small, practical projects to apply the concepts learned.

Deep Learning Concepts: Future notes on more advanced topics like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
