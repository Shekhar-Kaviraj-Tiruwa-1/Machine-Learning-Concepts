# 🚀 10-Second Recall Cards

## Course 1: Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression
**10-Second Revision**: *"Draw line through dots, minimize squared errors, gradient descent finds best weights"*

**Memory Palace**: Imagine throwing darts at a target - the line is your best aim through all the dart holes

**Key Formula**: `h(x) = wx + b`, Cost = `(1/2m)Σ(pred-actual)²`

**Rapid Check**: If cost goes up → learning rate too high!

---

### Logistic Regression  
**10-Second Revision**: *"Sigmoid squashes to 0-1 probabilities, threshold at 0.5, different cost function"*

**Memory Palace**: Traffic light - green (>0.5) = go/positive class, red (<0.5) = stop/negative class

**Key Formula**: `h(x) = 1/(1+e^-z)` where `z = wx + b`

**Rapid Check**: Sigmoid(0) = 0.5, Sigmoid(∞) = 1, Sigmoid(-∞) = 0

---

### Neural Networks
**10-Second Revision**: *"Stacked logistic regression, layers process step-by-step, weights connect everything"*

**Memory Palace**: Factory assembly line - each station (layer) adds more sophistication to the product

**Key Concept**: More layers = more complex patterns, but need more data

**Rapid Check**: Network with n inputs, h hidden, 1 output needs `n×h + h×1` weights

---

# Course 2: Advanced Algorithms

### Deep Neural Networks
**10-Second Revision**: *"Many layers learn features hierarchically, ReLU for hidden layers, backprop updates weights"*

**Memory Palace**: Learning to recognize faces - first see edges, then shapes, then features, then identity

**Key Insight**: ReLU > Sigmoid for hidden layers (no vanishing gradient)

**Rapid Check**: Training loss << Validation loss = Overfitting

---

### Decision Trees
**10-Second Revision**: *"20 questions game, maximize information gain, entropy measures uncertainty"*

**Memory Palace**: Detective solving mystery - each question eliminates suspects until finding culprit

**Key Formula**: `Entropy = -Σ p_i log₂(p_i)`, Pure node = 0, Most mixed = 1

**Rapid Check**: Best split = maximum information gain

---

### Ensemble Methods
**10-Second Revision**: *"Many experts vote together, Random Forest parallel, Boosting sequential fixes errors"*

**Memory Palace**: Democracy - each model votes, majority wins (Random Forest) vs Learning from mistakes (Boosting)

**Key Insight**: Ensemble > Single model (reduces overfitting)

**Rapid Check**: 100 trees, 60 vote A, 40 vote B → Predict A

---

# Course 3: Unsupervised Learning

### K-Means Clustering
**10-Second Revision**: *"Group similar points, move centers to average, repeat until stable"*

**Memory Palace**: Party planning - group people by interests, find natural gathering spots

**Key Algorithm**: Assign → Update centroids → Repeat

**Rapid Check**: Choose K using elbow method (cost vs K plot)

---

### Anomaly Detection
**10-Second Revision**: *"Model normal with Gaussian bell curve, flag unusual low-probability events"*

**Memory Palace**: Airport security - normal passengers vs suspicious outliers

**Key Formula**: `p(x) < ε` → Anomaly

**Rapid Check**: Small ε = strict (few alarms), Large ε = lenient (many alarms)

---

### Recommender Systems
**10-Second Revision**: *"Content uses item features, collaborative uses user similarity, matrix factorization finds hidden patterns"*

**Memory Palace**: Librarian recommendations - either book genre (content) or "others like you" (collaborative)

**Key Types**: Content-based, Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization

**Rapid Check**: Cold start problem = new user/item with no data

---

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**10-Second Revision**: *"Find max variance directions, project data, keep 95-99% info with fewer features"*

**Memory Palace**: Shadow puppet - 3D object creates 2D shadow keeping main shape

**Key Process**: Normalize → Covariance → Eigenvectors → Project

**Rapid Check**: Choose components to retain 95-99% variance

```

## Formula Memory Palace
**Room 1 - Linear Models**: Walk into a house, see a straight line drawn on the wall (Linear Regression)
**Room 2 - S-Curve**: Next room has an S-shaped curve (Sigmoid for Logistic)
**Room 3 - Network**: Third room has interconnected lights (Neural Network)

# ⚡ Lightning Mental Models

## The Bias-Variance Seesaw
- **High Bias** (Underfitting): Too simple, like using straight line for curved data
- **High Variance** (Overfitting): Too complex, memorizes noise
- **Sweet Spot**: Balanced complexity for your data size

## The Learning Rate Goldilocks
- **Too High**: Steps too big, jumps over minimum (cost explodes)
- **Too Low**: Steps too small, takes forever (slow learning)  
- **Just Right**: Steady decrease in cost function

## The Data Size Rule of Thumb
- **Small Data** (< 1000): Simple models (Linear, Logistic, Trees)
- **Medium Data** (1K - 100K): Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Large Data** (100K+): Neural Networks (they need lots of data)

# 🎲 Rapid Problem-Solving Framework

## The 30-Second Problem Solver
1. **Identify** (5s): Supervised or Unsupervised? Regression or Classification?
2. **Choose** (10s): Right algorithm based on data size and complexity
3. **Validate** (10s): Train/Val/Test split, appropriate metrics
4. **Debug** (5s): Check for overfitting, learning rate, data quality

## Emergency Debugging Checklist
- ❌ **Cost exploding?** → Reduce learning rate
- ❌ **Not learning?** → Increase learning rate or check derivatives  
- ❌ **Perfect training, bad test?** → Add regularization
- ❌ **Bad training and test?** → More complex model or better features
- ❌ **Random performance?** → Check for bugs in implementation

# 🎯 Exam/Interview Prep

## Most Likely Questions
1. **Explain bias-variance tradeoff** → Simple vs Complex models
2. **When to use Random Forest vs Neural Networks?** → Structured vs Raw data
3. **How to handle overfitting?** → More data, regularization, simpler model
4. **Difference between K-means and hierarchical clustering?** → Fixed K vs automatic hierarchy
5. **Why use cross-validation?** → Better estimate of true performance

## Key Formulas to Memorize
```
Linear: h(x) = wx + b
Logistic: h(x) = 1/(1 + e^-(wx+b))  
Cost (Linear): (1/2m)Σ(h(x)-y)²
Cost (Logistic): -(1/m)Σ[y log(h) + (1-y)log(1-h)]
Entropy: -Σ p_i log₂(p_i)
Gradient Descent: w := w - α(∂J/∂w)
```

## Implementation Gotchas
- Always normalize/scale features for neural networks
- Check learning rate if cost doesn't decrease
- Use appropriate metrics (not just accuracy for imbalanced data)
- Validate on unseen data, not training data
- Watch for data leakage (using future info to predict past)
